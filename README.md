# GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score

- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn

- Moreover, if a player rolls a 6 twice in a row, his entire score gets lost
which means his ROUND score as well as his GLOBAL score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn

- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn

- Before starting the game, a winning point must have to be chosen.

- The first player to reach specified winning points on GLOBAL score wins the game
